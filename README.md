# Mass of a Trisolaran droplet

This project complements an article in which I try to calculate the mass of a Trisolaran droplet from Liu Cixin's Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy using different assumptions in order to determine if its book description is theoretically feasible, and if so, which materials have most likely been used.

## dropletRender.m
This script renders a Longchamps piriform in 2D and 3D, which is the shape chosen to model the droplet's shape.

## dropletCalc.m
This script contains numerical applications to calculate areas, volume, area density, and mass of a piriform droplet and its simple shape approximation.
